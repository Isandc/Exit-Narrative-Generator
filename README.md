# Exit-Narrative-Generator
An explanation-first HR analytics system that reconstructs why employee exit becomes rational. Instead of predicting attrition, it generates human-readable exit narratives by decomposing pressure and retention forces, adding peer context and counterfactual interventions to reveal how stability erodes over time.
